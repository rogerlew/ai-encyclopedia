# Secure and Controllable" Encryption

_Grok 3 (beta) think_

China's approach to "secure and controllable" encryption and cryptography is a cornerstone of its national security and economic development strategies. The term "secure and controllable" refers to cryptographic systems that are trustworthy, domestically developed or approved, and accessible to the Chinese government when necessary. This reflects China's broader cybersecurity framework, which prioritizes state oversight, data protection, and technological sovereignty amid geopolitical tensions and ambitions to lead in emerging technologies.

### **Key Aspects of "Secure and Controllable" Encryption**

#### **1. The Encryption Law (2019)**
China's Encryption Law, enacted in 2019 and effective from January 1, 2020, provides the legal foundation for its encryption policies. The law categorizes encryption into three types:
- **Core Encryption**: Protects highly sensitive state secrets (e.g., "top secret" level) and is subject to strict government regulation.
- **Ordinary Encryption**: Safeguards less critical state secrets (e.g., "secret" or "highly secret") with similar oversight.
- **Commercial Encryption**: Used by businesses and individuals for non-state secret data, with lighter regulation but still requiring compliance with national standards.

The law is administered by the **State Cryptography Administration (SCA)**, which oversees the development, certification, and use of encryption products. It aims to balance national security with economic growth by encouraging commercial encryption while ensuring government control over systems protecting state interests.

#### **2. Government Oversight and Access**
A defining feature of "secure and controllable" encryption is the Chinese government's ability to access encrypted data. Although the Encryption Law does not explicitly mandate backdoors, it stipulates that encryption must not "harm national security or public interests." This vague wording suggests that companies may need to provide decryption capabilities or share encryption keys with authorities when requested, particularly in critical sectors like telecommunications or finance. The **Ministry of Public Security (MPS)** and SCA can inspect cryptographic systems, aligning with China's broader cybersecurity laws that prioritize state transparency over data.

#### **3. Indigenous Cryptographic Standards**
China emphasizes homegrown cryptographic algorithms to reduce dependence on foreign technology, a priority heightened by concerns over foreign surveillance (e.g., post-Snowden leaks in 2013). The **National Information Security Standardization Technical Committee** develops these standards, often excluding foreign input in key areas like encryption (e.g., Working Group 3). This push for self-reliance ensures that cryptographic systems are "controllable" by the state and less vulnerable to external exploitation.

#### **4. Economic and Technological Goals**
Encryption is viewed as a "strategic resource" for China's digital economy. The government promotes its use in industries like **blockchain** and **digital currencies**, where cryptography is foundational. For instance:
- China has prioritized blockchain development, with the Politburo studying its potential and the country launching a central bank digital currency (CBDC).
- Commercial encryption is liberalized to some extent to foster innovation, with fewer restrictions on foreign firms, provided their products meet SCA certification.

This reflects a dual goal: securing data while positioning China as a global leader in cryptography-dependent technologies.

#### **5. Implications for Foreign Companies**
Foreign businesses operating in China face unique challenges under these policies:
- They may need to use **government-approved encryption** or certify their products with the SCA.
- There’s a risk of being required to share encryption keys or proprietary data, especially in critical infrastructure sectors.
- In 2017, the SCA certified a foreign company (NXP) for the first time, hinting at cautious openness, though national security remains the overriding concern.

### **Broader Context**

#### **Cybersecurity Framework**
The "secure and controllable" concept fits into China’s wider cybersecurity regime, including the **Cybersecurity Law (2017)** and **Multi-Level Protection Scheme (MLPS 2.0)**. These laws mandate data localization and government access to data, with encryption serving as both a shield against external threats and a tool ensuring state visibility. The goal is networks that are "opaque to bad actors but transparent to the government."

#### **Emerging Technologies**
China’s encryption strategy also looks to the future:
- **Blockchain**: Supported as a driver of economic growth, but with controls to prevent decentralized systems from evading oversight.
- **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**: Investments in post-quantum algorithms aim to counter the threat of quantum computing to traditional encryption.

### **Conclusion**
China’s "secure and controllable" encryption reflects a careful balance between security and innovation. The government seeks to protect national interests by maintaining oversight and promoting indigenous standards, while also fostering a competitive digital economy. For businesses and foreign entities, this means navigating a landscape where compliance with state requirements is non-negotiable, and for China, it’s a step toward cryptographic sovereignty and global technological leadership.
